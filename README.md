# Project_HR-Analytics_Predict-Employee-Attrition
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using HR data with a Decision Tree model. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and feature importance to identify key factors like overtime, job satisfaction, and salary that influence attrition. Helps HR improve retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes employee attributes such as Age, Department, Job Satisfaction, OverTime status, Monthly Income, Work Experience, Last Promotion, Education Field, Marital Status, and more.

## Objective
- Build a Decision Tree model to predict whether an employee will leave.
- Analyze key features influencing attrition.
- Provide actionable insights for HR retention strategies.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Encoding Categorical Variables  
4. Splitting Data into Train and Test sets  
5. Training the Decision Tree Classifier  
6. Evaluating Model Performance  
7. Analyzing Feature Importance and Insights
